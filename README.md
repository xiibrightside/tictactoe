# Nano React App Default Javascript Template

The default template project for [nano-react-app](https://github.com/nano-react-app/nano-react-app).

- `npm start` — This will spawn a development server with a default port of `3000`.
- `npm run build` — This will output a production build in the `dist` directory.

## Babel transforms

The Babel preset [babel-preset-nano-react-app](https://github.com/nano-react-app/babel-preset-nano-react-app) is used to support the same transforms that Create React App supports.

The Babel configuration lives inside `package.json` and will override an external `.babelrc` file, so if you want to use `.babelrc` remember to delete the `babel` property inside `package.json`.
